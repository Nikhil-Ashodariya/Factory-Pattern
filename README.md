# Factory-Pattern
Factory Pattern is implemented in java language
The Factory.jar contains the .class file of AStack,LStack,IStack,QOS,StackFactory
when the service consumer requests for the stack from stackfactory and pass QOS parameter to stack factory then stack factory compares the parameter with array stack i.e.(AStack) and Link list stack i.e. (LStack) which ever is the first fit it returns the object of that class by initiating the class using reflection
